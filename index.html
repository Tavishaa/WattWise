        Did you know energy waste quietly drains your wallet and harms the
        environment? From forgotten lights to overused appliances, it adds up
        quickly—along with your bills and carbon footprint.
        <br>
        <br>
        The problem? Most people don't even realize how much they're wasting,
        and while smart home systems offer convenience, they miss the mark on
        inspiring real energy-saving habits.
